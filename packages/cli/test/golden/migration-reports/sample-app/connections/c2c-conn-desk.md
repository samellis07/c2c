## Field gaps

- email: 1 (Conn_Helpdesk_Case.Contact_Email) — There is no email column (API type email returns PATTERN_NOT_MATCHED). Stored as varchar plus a generated format check. Creator’s exact rule is unpublished, so the check can differ on edge cases.
- multi-line: 2 (Conn_Helpdesk_Case.Contact_Description, Conn_Helpdesk_Case.Helpdesk_Response) — Data Store text holds 10,000 characters. A generated length check rejects the rest. Multi-line formula output (up to 65,355) does not fit.
